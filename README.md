# Docker First Development Demo

## Description
This is demo code for a talk about using Docker to run tooling for your development environment, meaning there is no need to install anything locally thus ensuring immutability and consistency.

The applications are super basic JSON API's that return the same data schema.

## Usage
Within each directory there is a Makefile that includes helper commands for building and running the applications. Please read through these Makefiles to better understand the commands needed.

## Talk Slides
